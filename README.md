This a wonderful respinsive website for shopping your favorite and most trending sneakers foot wear int he town.

The application was developed using: HTML, CSS, Javascript
I was choosed this project because, I like ecommerce websites and I used very frequently in my day to day life and most of the Javascript DOM manipulations are been implemented in this project.

This ecommerce webiste has a very good UI and easy to use functionality and it is a single page website as well. We can add many more sections in future and I will make sure it will be a single page application and will not use many pages hence making the user stick to only one page.

The features of this website are:

- User can add an item to the cart by clicking on ADD TO CART
- An item, price and quantity will be added at the right section
- The user can select multiple items by increasing or decreasing the quantity
- The user if doesn't want the item can remove the item from the cart.
